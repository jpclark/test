# webapp

Problems to solve with a cloud based backend.

## architecture
One instance of service running in same container for each user, "basic" subscription model.

Ability to subscribe to a standalone instance for very high traffic users, "premium" subscription model.

Custom services for high end clients.

## authentication
Application specific logins with email, or OAuth?
2FA - recommended or even required (phone/email/google auth app)

## browser support
need to choose which browsers are supported and tested out of the gate, add others after mvp is achieved.

## system administration interface/consoles
need admin tools for service, separate from admin console provided to users
extra security required here... this is absolutely paramount
