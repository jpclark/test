# test

## issues to solve:
other trackers create local database that must be managed and protected by the user of the app
- data can be easily lost
- data not easily backed up for non technical users
- possible security problems
- need cloud based data storage solution with strong security

most of these programs are platform dependent, mostly if not exclusively Windows based
- solution must be platform independent, easily portable
- solution must be as simple as possible to setup and use
- web based solution?
- running locally puts additional strain on user's machine, possibly degrades network performance if high number of users

security issues inherent with community, if cloud solution is used must have 2factor auth etc

## desired features
easily extended and configured
- graphical configuration
- easy to add/configure basic !command type behaviors 
- flexible, scriptable framework for creating custom behaviors with data rich backend capability
- good library of popular !commands that can be used off the shelf, seamless transition from other similar tools

simple data import from other popular apps
- graphical interface for import, point to location of folder and hit go
- backup existing data first then import, reduce liability as much as possible

admin console separate from backend for monitoring stats etc
- if going with web solution, admin console would be a webapp
